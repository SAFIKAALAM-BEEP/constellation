    <h1>The Legend of Orion and Scorpio</h1>

    <p>
      In the vast sky, two mighty constellations, Orion and Scorpio, are locked in an eternal chase. The mighty hunter, Orion, was known for his incredible strength and skill. He boasted that he could hunt down any creature, even the scorpions of the Earth. This angered the goddess Artemis, protector of the wild, who sent a giant scorpion to stop him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The great scorpion, Scorpio, fought Orion fiercely. After a long battle, Orion fell, and Scorpio triumphed. But the gods, in their wisdom, decided to immortalize both of them in the sky. Orion was placed in the heavens as a constellation, along with his belt and sword. Scorpio, too, was placed nearby, forever chasing Orion across the sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      And so, each night, as the stars twinkle above, Orion and Scorpio continue their chase — locked in a celestial dance that can never end.
