# Star Atlas

## About
A constellation map that talks about the constellation's stars along with personal thoughts and interests.
I originally wanted to create a mindmap where the user could learn about new things by clicking each constellation star and each star would be linked to other stars that would dig deeper into that topic. It would be like a "choose your own adventure" where the user could click on which star to go to next, representing how the internet is a place where people shared and learned new information. Especially, during the 90s since it was all new like a new world, a new map to charter. Unfortunately I realized I would not have time for that and switched to just having the stars link to their respective constellation pages.

I wanted it to portray colorfulness and diverse personalities of the 90s so each constellation page is inspired by different 90s websites. 

## The Constellations
- Ursa Major : links to a World Wide Web inspired website that discusses the first website. 
- Scorpius : links to a [Weezer](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/weezer-1996) inspired website that just links to other pages.
- Sagittarius : tells the story of Scorpius and Orion. Since his arrow is pointed at Scorpius' heart it seemed like he witnessed the lore. 
- Orion : links to a [Adventure West On-Line](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/adventure-west-on-line-1996) inspired website. I planned to put together a bunch of novels and movies that I liked.
- Canis Minor : links to my personal thoughts about learning about 90s websites.
- Libra : Supposed to be a bilbiography page. 

I unfortunately did not get the chance to finish all the constellation pages. Nor finishing building each constellation. 

## Key Features
- The constellations!! You can click on their stars to read about their stars or learn about the constellation in the hover messages! They are not super accurate to scale. 
- The popouts!! The space objects (orca, asteroid, voyager 1, tetris) were all supposed to have popouts with interesting information. Unfortunately, was not able to finish (っ °Д °;)っ
- Probably the first thing you noticed-NYAN CAT!!! Click on it and it'll lead you to a secret cat party. (Based off [Hamster Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampster_Dance))
- The music: Main Page - [Skies Forever Blue 8 Bit](https://youtu.be/qjLYKgQS8d4?si=2dI8qiok2R40j27z) and Nyan Cat Page - [Maxwell](https://youtu.be/ffzmWSV2cws?si=ZrrLpk6M89PN8JUz)
- All the pages are connected to the Star Atlas page so they're all connected! Feel free to explore!
- Finally, the sparkling stars... They're nice to look at.

## What I used: 
Including the media above I also used images and gifs from online. I used google fonts and for the project I used html, css, and javascript! 

## Last Thoughts
Thank you Codex for holding this hackathon. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun. I'm glad this hackathon was my first.
